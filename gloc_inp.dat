# Parameters are:

PARAMETERS FOR CENTRIFUGE EXPERIMENT MODELING 
1. G0          local gravity field in g, typically =1
2. Gmax        maximum Gz for experiment

PARAMETERS FOR HUMAN PARTICIPANT PHYSIOLOGY 
3. fnorm       normal blood flow rate through brain in dl/min (45-54)
4. fmax        maximum blood flow rate through brain (about 110) 
5. fcon        blood flow needed through brain to maintain consciousness (17-20)
6. flife       blood flow needed through brain to maintain brain cell life (8-10)
7. gtm         g tolerance time multiplier for studied population, 
               usually = 1.0, but can be as great as 1.53 using breathing techniques
               (this is an obsolete coding to include AGSM) 
8. beta        time constant in seconds for heart rate response function
                  (This should be about 1/7 the time to ramp up to full response.)
				  2-3 seem typical (15-20 seconds to reach max effect)
9. BSP         baseline systolic blood pressure (typically 110-140)
10. BDP        baseline diastolic blood pressure (typically 60-90)
               From J.E. Sharman and A. LaGerche. "Exercise Blood Pressure" 
               Journal of Human Hypertension 29, 351-8 (2015).  
11. MSP        maximum exercising systolic blood pressure (range 130-234)
12. MDP        maximum exercising diastolic blood pressure (range 56-100)
13. conbank    seconds of consciousness if oxygen flow stops. This is experimentally 
               shown to range from 5 to 15 seconds from rapid decompression
               and choke collar reports, 10 seems a reasonable midrange
14. lifebank   seconds of life of brain life if blood flow stops minus conbank 
               (typically accepted value is about 3 minutes). 180 sec is large 
			   enough that it does not effect time to GLOC or RTC times

MORE PARAMETERS FOR CENTRIFUGE EXPERIMENT MODELING 
15. gmaxtime   seconds held at Gmax
    (To simulate a particular experiment set 11,12, and 13 to >0.0,
      otherwise a set of 30 simulations at predetermined dG/dt steps
	  will be done based on values of 12 and 13.
      If 12 is 0.0 then a set of 30 return to con sims will  
	  be done. If 13 is 0.0 a set of 30 GLOC induction sims will be 
	  run. If both are 0.0 then a set of 30 sims up to GLOC and back
      to consciousness at the opposite dGdt after time gmaxtime 
	  will be run.)   	  
16. rampup     positive rate of change in Gz (g/s) towards GLOC
17. rampdown   negative rate of change in GZ after gmaxtime in g/s

MORE PARAMETERS FOR HUMAN PARTICIPANT PHYSIOLOGY 
18. male       1=true/0=false (i.e. false = use female data)
19. howtall    height of subject in cm (U.S. fighter pilot range is 162.6-195.6 cm)
               used to calculate the heart-brain vertical distance, which is a slightly 
			   less than the heart-eye vertical distance.

PARAMETERS FOR COUNTERMEASURES
20. smpsi      max pressure in PSI of anti-g suite, net effect is added g tolerance by
               increase of internal pressures at heart level and from slightly raising 
               the physical location of the heart in the chest cavity.
               This added g tolerance from any pressure suit worn: use 0.0 for no gear 
               (about 22 PSI is max.  0.8-1.0 Gz for WW2 era gear to 1.5-2.0 for modern gear)
21. sbc        suit body coverage (more coverage can double effectiveness, but less comfortable.
               standard military is 30-35%, can be up to 85%
22. agsm       Effectiveness of the anti-G straining maneuver 0.0-1.0, optimal effectiveness will
               increase intra-throracic pressure by as much as about 130 mmHg. 
23. pbg        Pressurized breathing gear raises pressure in the chest cavity to assist breathing 
               under high G. Maximum useful pressure is about 60 mmHg.  
24. nagsm0     Starting increase in mean arterial pressure in the absence of AGSM due to other 
               muscle strains, such as tightly gripping an object. Such tensing can 
               increase mean arterial pressure at heart level by as much as 60 mmHg.  
               A single tight grip can increase HLAP by 15 mmHg. 0 for relaxed. 
25. nagsm max  Maximum allowed non-agsm straining increase. This will ramp-up in about 30 seconds 
               to reach full effect if nagsm0 = 0 when the modeling begins.               
26. seattilt   angle of seat tilted from vertical, if any, used to correct heart-brain distance. 
               (e.g., 0-10 for typical, 30 deg for an F-16).
               Lungs self-crushing from effective weight at large inclinations is also an issue 
               to consider, but not modeled in this version. 

PHARMACEUTICAL CARDIAC RESPONSE PARAMETER
27. DrugDelay  Usually 0 s. Pharmacologically induced time delay in heart response to stress 
               (e.g., metprolol can delay the initial heart rate increase by a few seconds).
